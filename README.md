The current study provides a detailed and complete statistical analysis for modeling net hourly electrical energy output (EP) of CCPP for the gas turbine input (GT), sixth input (ST) and CCPP combined cycle output (CC). The analysis uses a database of hourly average environmental variables observed during six years. The main aims are to investigate the dataset, to create and assess various non-linear polynomial regression models to predict volatile organic compound emissions, and to choose the optimal model according to statistical index and a residual analysis, then examine the parameters of the latter one using Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC).
For all analyses, R statistical software (Version details in Appendix) was employed. The methods and the results obtained, and the conclusions are presented in the following sections and tables and visualizations have been used for the purpose of analysis
